### *Relogo inteligent agent based simulation*

Tries to gracefully link two randomly generated two-dimensional maps of objects with different shapes, sizes and colors.

In package ds_memes_br.relogo you will find:

* [UserGlobalsAndPanelFactory](https://github.com/elcodedocle/PicDNA/blob/master/src/ds_memes_br/relogo/UserGlobalsAndPanelFactory.groovy) Sets simulation controls.
* [UserObserver](https://github.com/elcodedocle/PicDNA/blob/master/src/ds_memes_br/relogo/UserObserver.groovy) generates the maps.
* [ProtoMeme](https://github.com/elcodedocle/PicDNA/blob/master/src/ds_memes_br/relogo/ProtoMeme.groovy) establishes the inteligent agent's behaviour.

The rest are a bunch of tweaks on a default Relogo Framework for Repast Simphony 2 eclipse project.

## How to use

* clone the repo
* import the project and run it from eclipse indigo included on [Repast Simphony 2.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/repast/files/Repast%20Simphony/Repast%20Simphony%202.0/).

In case you have any trouble, the simulation runs nice on [Java SE 6 U31](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html)
