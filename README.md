### *Relogo intelligent agent based simulation*

Tries to gracefully link two randomly generated two-dimensional maps of objects with different shapes, sizes and colors.

In package `ds_memes_br.relogo` you will find:

* [UserGlobalsAndPanelFactory](https://github.com/elcodedocle/PicDNA/blob/master/src/ds_memes_br/relogo/UserGlobalsAndPanelFactory.groovy) sets the controls you see during the simulation.
* [UserObserver](https://github.com/elcodedocle/PicDNA/blob/master/src/ds_memes_br/relogo/UserObserver.groovy) generates the two-dimensional maps.
* [ProtoMeme](https://github.com/elcodedocle/PicDNA/blob/master/src/ds_memes_br/relogo/ProtoMeme.groovy) establishes the inteligent agents' behaviour.

The rest are a bunch of tweaks on a default Relogo Framework for Repast Simphony 2 eclipse project.

## How to use

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/elcodedocle/PicDNA`
* Import the project and run it from eclipse indigo included on [Repast Simphony 2.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/repast/files/Repast%20Simphony/Repast%20Simphony%202.0/).

(In case you have any trouble, the simulation runs nice on [Java SE 6 U31](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html))
